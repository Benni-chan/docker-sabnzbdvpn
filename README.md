[![Docker Image Size (tag)](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/dyonr/sabnzbdvpn/latest)](https://hub.docker.com/r/dyonr/sabnzbdvpn)

Docker container which runs the latest [SABnzbd](https://github.com/sabnzbd/SABnzbd) client while connecting to WireGuard or OpenVPN with iptables killswitch to prevent IP leakage when the tunnel goes down.

## Docker Features
* Base: Debian bullseye-slim
* [SABnzbd](https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd)
* Selectively enable or disable WireGuard or OpenVPN support
* IP tables killswitch to prevent IP leaking when VPN connection fails
* Specify name servers to add to container
* Configure UID and GID for config files and blackhole for SABnzbd
* HTTPS (default, port 8443) and HTTP (port 8080) Web UI
* Created with [Unraid](https://unraid.net/) in mind

## Volumes
| Volume | Required | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| `config` | Yes | SABnzbd, WireGuard and OpenVPN config files | `/your/config/path/:/config`|
| `downloads` | No | Default downloads path for saving magnet links | `/your/downloads/path/:/downloads`|

## Ports
| Port | Proto | Required | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| `8080` | TCP | Yes | SABnzbd WebUI (HTTP) | `8080:8080`|
| `8443` | TCP | Yes | SABnzbd WebUI (HTTPS) | `8443:8443`|

# Access the WebUI
Access https://IPADDRESS:PORT from a browser on the same network. (for example: http://192.168.0.90:8443)

# How to use WireGuard 
The container will fail to boot if `VPN_ENABLED` is set and there is no valid .conf file present in the /config/wireguard directory. Drop a .conf file from your VPN provider into /config/wireguard and start the container again. The file must have the name `wg0.conf`. 

# How to use OpenVPN
The container will fail to boot if `VPN_ENABLED` is set and there is no valid .ovpn file present in the /config/openvpn directory. Drop a .ovpn file from your VPN provider into /config/openvpn and start the container again. You may need to edit the ovpn configuration file to load your VPN credentials from a file by setting `auth-user-pass`.

**Note:** The script will use the first ovpn file it finds in the /config/openvpn directory. Adding multiple ovpn files will not start multiple VPN connections.

## Example auth-user-pass option for .ovpn files
`auth-user-pass credentials.conf`

## Example credentials.conf
```
username
password
```

## PUID/PGID
User ID (PUID) and Group ID (PGID) can be found by issuing the following command for the user you want to run the container as:

```
id <username>
```

# Issues
If you are having issues with this container please submit an issue on GitHub.  
Please provide logs, Docker version and other information that can simplify reproducing the issue.  
If possible, always use the most up to date version of Docker, you operating system, kernel and the container itself. Support is always a best-effort basis.  
**I personally do not use SABnzbd, thus providing support about the product is nearly impossible for me.**
